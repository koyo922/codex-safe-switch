One command to switch [Codex CLI](https://github.com/openai/codex) provider configs — official OpenAI provider, third-party relays, multiple API keys. CLI + optional Alfred workflow.

## New here? Start with this

**What it solves:** Codex CLI talks to one provider at a time. Hand-editing `~/.codex/config.toml` to switch between a relay and your official account easily corrupts local state — especially **session-history metadata** — so switching back leaves your **history list empty**. This tool stores each provider as a profile, swaps only the provider slice, and realigns history on every switch, so your sessions stay visible no matter how often you flip.

**30-second path:**

```bash
uv tool install codex-safe-switch   # 1. install (needs uv)
codex-safe-switch                   # 2. just run it = interactive picker; first run imports your current config
codex-safe-switch save myrelay      # 3. snapshot the current provider as a profile named `myrelay`
codex-safe-switch official          # 4. one command back to official OpenAI
```

If your current config is the official OpenAI login on first run, the tool automatically stores the provider slice in the hidden profile `~/.codex/profiles/.official/`, and the active name shows as `official`. You can also refresh it explicitly while the official config is active:

```bash
codex-safe-switch save official     # saves official provider config only; never saves auth.json
```

**If you found this *because* your history disappeared after a switch:** don't panic — the history files are usually still there, the metadata just no longer matches the active provider.

```bash
uv tool install codex-safe-switch
codex-safe-switch doctor-history    # read-only: see which provider/model your history points at
codex-safe-switch use <profile>     # switch to the provider the history belongs to; this realigns it (use/official both do)
# Want to repair in place without switching:
codex-safe-switch merge-history --dry-run   # preview the changes first
codex-safe-switch merge-history             # write them once it looks right
```

> None of this touches `~/.codex/auth.json`, so your official ChatGPT login is never overwritten. See "What makes it safe" below for the details.

## Install

```bash
uv tool install codex-safe-switch
```

Requires [`uv`](https://github.com/astral-sh/uv). Installs `codex-safe-switch` onto `$PATH` (default `~/.local/bin/`).

## Quick start

```bash
codex-safe-switch           # interactive picker (↑/↓, enter to switch)
codex-safe-switch ls        # list profiles, ★ marks the active one
codex-safe-switch save dev  # snapshot current ~/.codex state as `dev`
codex-safe-switch official  # switch back to the official OpenAI provider
```

First run imports your existing `~/.codex/config.toml` so nothing is lost.

codex-safe-switch use [name]   # load <name>; omit for the picker
codex-safe-switch save <name>  # snapshot the current provider config as <name>
codex-safe-switch save <name> --openai-auth-bearer-env RELAY_TOKEN
                               # save a ChatGPT-auth relay profile with a bearer token
codex-safe-switch save official
                               # refresh the hidden official snapshot when the current config is official OpenAI
codex-safe-switch show <name>  # print <name>'s provider.toml and session state
codex-safe-switch state <name> # show/set the session-state scope for a profile
codex-safe-switch rm <name>    # delete profile (the active one is protected)
codex-safe-switch restart-codex
                               # terminate Codex app/server processes so a switch takes effect
codex-safe-switch merge-history --dry-run
                               # preview history metadata changes without writing files
codex-safe-switch doctor-history
                               # inspect current history provider/model state read-only
codex-safe-switch alfred-list  # JSON for Alfred Script Filter
```

`use` / `official` both accept `--restart-codex` to bounce the Codex app/server in one step.

The picker auto-falls back to a numeric menu when stdin/stdout aren't TTYs (pipes, scripts).

<summary><strong>Alfred workflow</strong></summary>

After `uv tool install`, double-click `alfred/codex-safe-switch.alfredworkflow`. Trigger with keyword `cx`.

The workflow calls `$HOME/.local/bin/codex-safe-switch`. If `uv tool install` put the binary elsewhere (`uv tool dir --bin` to check), edit the two `script` blocks in the workflow's plist accordingly.

<summary><strong>What makes it "safe"</strong></summary>

**Only the provider slice is swapped — local state is preserved.** A profile owns these keys/tables in `~/.codex/config.toml`; everything else (trusted projects, plugins, marketplaces, MCP servers, TUI prefs, etc.) is left untouched:

- `model`, `model_provider`, `model_reasoning_effort`, `model_reasoning_summary`, `model_verbosity`
- `wire_api`, `disable_response_storage`, `preferred_auth_method`
- `[model_providers.*]`

**`auth.json` is not managed.** Profiles only store provider-related config; `~/.codex/auth.json` stays owned by Codex itself. `save`, `use`, and `official` never save or write back `auth.json`, so switching providers does not overwrite your official ChatGPT login cache or local auth state.

**Only the active provider block is saved.** If `model_provider = "..."` is commented out, `save` will not treat a remaining `[model_providers.<name>]` block below it as the current profile. If `model_provider = "relay"` is active, only `[model_providers.relay]` is saved; other provider blocks are left out.

**History is aligned by default.** Every `use` / `official` aligns local Codex history metadata to the active provider and model, so session history stays visible across relays and the official OpenAI login:

- Rollout files and the `state_5.sqlite` threads table get fixed automatically.
- If `session_index.jsonl` has fallen behind the latest threads in SQLite, the switch appends repaired index entries so mobile history lists don't stay pinned to an older point.
- On hosts that have used Codex remote-control, the switch also checks the managed app-server path and clears stale unix sockets / stale SSH remote proxy processes.
- `merge-history --keep-models` does a provider-only repair; `--dry-run` previews; `doctor-history` is read-only diagnostics.

**One-step back to official.** `codex-safe-switch official` is the shortcut back to the official OpenAI provider. The tool keeps a hidden provider snapshot at `~/.codex/profiles/.official/`, refreshed automatically the first time you switch away from official.

You can also run `codex-safe-switch save official` while the current config is official OpenAI to refresh that hidden snapshot explicitly. If the current config is not official OpenAI, the command refuses to run so a relay cannot be saved as `official` by mistake.

**Process isolation.** `restart-codex` (and `--restart-codex`) precisely skips the `codex-safe-switch` process itself so it never kills its own switch.

**Remote login risk warnings.** If the current `auth.json` is a ChatGPT login but the active provider uses `env_key` or `[model_providers.<name>.auth]`, `use` and `restart-codex` warn that Codex Remote / ChatGPT-backed app features may not stay signed in. Normal API-key relays still work; use `--openai-auth-bearer-env` when the relay should keep mobile Remote, plugins, and Codex App on the ChatGPT auth path.

<summary><strong>Profile layout + adding a relay</strong></summary>

```text
~/.codex/profiles/
├── .active                       # plaintext: name of the active profile
├── .official/
│   └── provider.toml             # official OpenAI provider slice
└── myrelay/
    └── provider.toml             # only provider-related keys (see examples/)
```

**Add a normal API-key relay profile**

1. Configure the relay normally in `~/.codex/config.toml` and verify `codex` works.
2. If the key comes from the environment, set `env_key = "..."` in the provider config; profiles do not need or store `auth.json`.
3. `codex-safe-switch save <name>` — snapshots the provider slice into a new profile.
4. Use `cx` (Alfred) or `codex-safe-switch use <name>` to switch anytime.

**Add a relay profile that keeps ChatGPT login / Codex Remote available**

Some relays still need Codex to stay on the ChatGPT/OpenAI auth path so Codex App, plugins, mobile Remote, and other ChatGPT-backed capabilities keep working. Put the relay token in an environment variable, then run:

```bash
codex-safe-switch save myrelay --openai-auth-bearer-env MYRELAY_TOKEN
```

This saves the active provider with:

- `requires_openai_auth = true`
- `experimental_bearer_token = "<current value of MYRELAY_TOKEN>"`
- `preferred_auth_method = "chatgpt"`

It also removes `env_key` and `[model_providers.<name>.auth]` from that provider so Codex does not enter the API-key / bearer-only auth path. Note that this mode writes the bearer token into the profile file and into `~/.codex/config.toml` when the profile is active; protect those files like `auth.json`.

You can also hand-author profile files — see `examples/relay-profile/`.
